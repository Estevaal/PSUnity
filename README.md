# PSUnity
Monitoring systems using Powershell and Unity

See article here: https://balladelli.com/psunity/

Bear with me, it's a V1. Feedback is really appreciated.
If you need help in setting it up, I will be glad to help too. 
I've been running PSUnity on a large monitor in an open space at my customer site for weeks now connected to SCOM.

Hope you will enjoy,
Micky
